              <h1><b>My name is Shierlene Lasic, and I'm a college student at Marinduque State College studying Information and Technology. I'm from Torrijos Marinduque.The reason why I took this course is that I'm so curious of how things are created in terms of technology like when I was in highschool I overthinked of how applications are made, how mobile and online games were created. And I really admire those developer who made one of those applications we used to rely on. That's why I took ICT strand when I was in senior high because I want to learn something about creating of applications that early. But sadly we didn't discussed about programming, we focused on networking and I'm a qualified CSS NCII Passer in Tesda. But now that I'm a college student I can now enjoy my dream. I got a chance to make my own application in our subject. I enjoyed making one, it's not that easy but I want to see the result of my hardwork and motivation.</h1>
